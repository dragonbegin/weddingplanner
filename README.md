# Wedding Planner Portfolio

Pitch: As a wedding planner I want to be able to show off my work. I have a lot of amazing pics from the weddings i’ve planned I'd like to share with potential clients, but I need a site that is more professional than Instagram in order to do so. I don’t have time or skills to build my own unique website, I need a site that provides templates so I can just input some information and be done. 

MVP Features Breakdown:

This app contains two user types. A wedding planner (who has the ability to log in) and a single user (no need to log in so no need for user data to be persisted on this user type) who can view portfolios. 
*Onboarding process for wedding planner. Include their location and contact info for people to reach them. 
*Login Page - After a user logs in, they'll be directed to their portfolio page where they can view what they have posted. They can also click to edit or delete posts. 
*Navigation - Navigation is present on all pages, Users should know what page is active by clicking on a nav link and activating their tab.
*Create Post Page - Allows a user to come in and create a post of a wedding. Each post needs to have an image, description, wedding location, wedding theme, and list of vendors they managed.  (You can hard code the image in for MVP-no need to upload photos for MVP. Stretch goals will include image uploading and the use of Cloudinary API etc. )
*Home Page for non-logged in users - Navigating to the home page Users can view posts of different wedding planners laid out in a single format. Users can click on a single post to read more of the description etc. They can filter by planner name, location, or theme. 

Stretch Goal: Build an image uploader into the site to allow users the ability to upload their own pictures. (This will require some work with a package called Drop Zone and a service called cloudinary).
